* Data Generation Method
We used the python library =youtube-dl= to build a crawler (=youtube-csv.py=). The crawler gets a youtube playlist 
as input and downloads the MPD's for all videos contained in this playlist. For our evaluation we used a playlist 
which contains the 500 most played videos of all time (=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2r5g8xGajEwdXd3x1sZh8hC=). 
This results in a database of 500 MPD files for evaluation.

The output of the crawling process are two CSV files. In the first file (=representation_stats.csv=) each line represents a single 
representation of a MPD. In the second file (=video_stats.csv=) each line represents a single MPD along with the number of
representations contained in it. Among others we included following data fields into these files:

- *Youtube ID*: The video this representation belongs to. Each video has a unique ID.
- *Video Codec*: The video codec used in this representation.
- *Width*: The width of the video.
- *Height*: The height of the video.
- *FPS*: Frames per Second of this representation.
- *Bitrate*: The bitrate of this representation.

* Data Analysis Method
For data analysis and visualization we build an EXCEL sheet (=Evaluation.xlsx=)to which we imported the CSV files generated
by the crawler. Using EXCEL's visualization tools, it was easy to generate some diagrams for the imported data.
