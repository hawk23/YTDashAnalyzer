* Data Generation Method
We used the python library =youtube-dl= to build a crawler (=youtube-csv.py=). The crawler gets a youtube playlist 
as input and downloads the MPD's for all videos contained in this playlist. For our evaluation we used a playlist 
which contains the 500 most played videos of all time. This results in a database of 500 MPD files for evaluation.

The output of the crawling process are two CSV files. In the first file (=representation_stats.csv=) each line represents a single 
representation of a MPD. In the second file (=video_stats.csv=) each line represents a single MPD along with the number of
representations contained in it. Among others we included following data fields into these files:

- *Youtube ID*: The video this representation belongs to. Each video has a unique ID.
- *Video Codec*: The video codec used in this representation.
- *Width*: The width of the video.
- *Height*: The height of the video.
- *FPS*: Frames per Second of this representation.
- *Bitrate*: The bitrate of this representation.

* Data Analysis Method
For data analysis and visualization we build an EXCEL sheet (=Evaluation.xlsx=)to which we imported the CSV files generated
by the crawler. Using EXCEL's visualization tools, it was easy to generate some diagrams for the imported data.

* Results
From the expected 500 MPD's only 497 could be loaded cause three of the videos where not available in Austria.

** Analysis of spatial resolutions
Our dataset contained 88 differenct spatial resoutions which where used by YouTube. In [[fig:1]] only the 20 most
used resoutions are shown. There are a lot of resolutions which where only used two or three times in our
dataset.

The most used resolution is *640x360* followed by *1280x720*. As [[fig:1]] reveals, the MPD's mostly contain 
one adaptation set for mp4/avc and one adaptation set for webm/vp9.

There is an significant decrease in the frequency after the first 6 most frequent resolutions. These six
resolutions seem to be the standard resolutions used in most of the MPD's.

** Analysis of video bitrates
Since the bitrate values where very different (3358 different values) we assigned the to several bins:

- <= 64 kbit/s
- 65 - 128 kbit/s
- 129 - 256 kbit/s
- 257 - 512 kbit/s
- 513 - 1024 kbit/s
- 1025 - 2048 kbit/s
- 2049 - 4096 kbit/s
- > 4096 kbit/s

For the higher bitrates larger than 4096 kbit/s mainly mp4/avc was used for videos. For all other lower
bitrates mp4/avc and webm/vp9 are nearly evenly used.

** Number of Representations
As you can see in figure [[fig:3]] most of the MPD's contain 12 video representations. They are separated
into two adaptation sets, one for mp4/avc and one for webm/vp9, each containing 6 representations. These
six representations are also the most frequent as shown in figure [[fig:1]].
