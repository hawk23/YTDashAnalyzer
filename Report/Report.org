* Analysis Method
We used the python library =youtube-dl= to build a crawler (=youtube-stats.py=). The crawler gets a youtube playlist 
as input and downloads the MPD's for all videos contained in this playlist. For our evaluation we used a playlist 
which contains the 500 most played videos of all time (=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2r5g8xGajEwdXd3x1sZh8hC=). 
This results in a database of 500 MPD files for evaluation.

The output of the crawling process is a single =CSV= file where each line represents a single representation of a MPD. We 
included following data fields into this file:
